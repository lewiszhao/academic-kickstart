I received the M.S degree from Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, led by Prof. Jie Yang. After graduation, I worked in the Tencent, engaged in R&D for Tencent cloud. Now I am a lecture at the Chongqing University of Education, focusing on the research of computer vision.
